How to Transfer Spots in Imaris:
1) Open the MATLAB application, and find the script labeled “transfer_spots” (title of a tab within the central Editor window). If it is not already open in MATLAB, open the file from File Explorer. It should be a .m file, and its location within the file system is C:\Users\Heinsbroek Lab\Desktop\Imaris Matlab.
2) Open the Imaris application, so that MATLAB can “see” it.
3) With the script up, click the “Run” button in MATLAB (Home tab -> green triangle button).
4) Within the MATLAB command window, you should see the following prompt: "Within Imaris, please open the image with spots you would like to transfer, then press Enter..." Follow these instructions. Open your image in Imaris, then return to the MATLAB command window and press Enter.
Now you should see this message: "Now switch to the image you would like to transfer spots to, then press Enter..." Follow these instructions with the image you would like to transfer spots to.  
5) Now you should see some messages about what the code is doing as well as: 'Target image has ' # ' time points (0 to #) ' . Make sure this is the correct number of time points (only 1 for a static image). The final message should be “Spots successfully transferred!”, and you should be able to see the new spots in Imaris. 
6) If any of this doesn’t work, email me (smhauke@uab.edu) so that I can help troubleshoot.
7) Tell Claude he’s a great bot for helping to build such a useful script. :)
